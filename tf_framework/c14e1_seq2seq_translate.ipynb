In previous examples, we either relied on datasets that are already split this way or we used functionality inside of Keras when calling the fit() function. However, in this case, we want some more control ourselves because we will want to inspect a few select members of the test set in detail. We split the dataset by first creating a list test_indices, which contains a 20% (TEST_PERCENT) subset of all the numbers from 0 to N−1, where N is the size of our original dataset. We then create a list train_indices, which contains the remaining 80%. We can now use these lists to select a number of rows in the matrices representing the dataset and create two new collections of matrices, one to be used as training set and one to be used as test set. Finally, we create a third collection of matrices, which only contains 20 (SAMPLE_SIZE) random examples from the test dataset. We will use them to inspect the resulting translations in detail, but since that is a manual process, we limit ourselves to a small number of sentences.\n"

The decoder consists of an embedding layer, two LSTM layers, and a fully connected softmax layer. We define these as two separate models, which we later tie together. Four noteworthy outputs are the state outputs from the two encoder LSTM layers.

This argument instructs the LSTM object to return not only a variable representing the layer’s output but also variables representing the c and h states. Further, for a recurrent layer that feeds another recurrent layer, we need to provide the argument return_sequences=True so that the subsequent layer sees the outputs of each timestep. This is also true for the final recurrent layer if we want the network to produce an output during each timestep. For our encoder, we are only interested in the final state, so we do not set return_sequences to True for enc_layer2.\n",

In this example, we create our own training loop where we instruct fit() to train for only a single epoch at a time.

We provide the source sentence to the encoder model to create the resulting internal state and store to the variable last_states. We also initialize the variable prev_word_index with the index corresponding to the START symbol. We then enter the innermost loop and predict a single word using the decoder model. We also read out the internal state. This data is then used as input to the decoder model in the next iteration, and we iterate until the model produces a STOP token or until a given number of words have been produced. Finally, we convert the produced tokenized sequences into the corresponding word sequences and print them out.\n"
