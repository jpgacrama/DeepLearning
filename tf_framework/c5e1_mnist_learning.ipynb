In our case, the inputs are changed from a 28×28 array into an array of 784 elements. The second and third layers are both Dense layers, which means they are fully connected. The first argument tells how many neurons each layer should have, and the activation argument tells the type of activation function; we choose tanh and sigmoid, where sigmoid means the logistic sigmoid function.

We provide parameters to specify which loss function to use, the optimizer that we just created and that we are interested in looking at the accuracy metric during training.
